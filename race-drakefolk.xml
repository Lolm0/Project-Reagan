    <description>
      <p>Drake folk are rare creatures, most are seen as great warriors or descendants of great warriors, they are seen as prideful, strong, and noble.</p>
      <h4>Origins</h4>
      <p>These mystical beings are formed through the mystical energy emanating from the body of a deceased dragon. As natural sorcerers, dragons possess an inherent magical essence that permeates their surroundings. However, it is important to note that not all members of the Drake-folk race are the result of exposure to this energy, as some are born into the race.</p>
      <p>When two Drake-folk parents have a child, the child is referred to as a true Drake-folk, and there is no distinction between a true Drake-folk and a child born to a Drake-folk and another race. </p>
