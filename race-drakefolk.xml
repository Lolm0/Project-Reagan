      <p class="flavor"> The Drake-folk are an elusive species, often regarded as either exceptional warriors or descendants of renowned fighters. They are widely recognized for their sense of pride, strength, and nobility. </p>
      <h4>ORIGINS</h4>
      <p> These mystical beings are formed through the mystical energy emanating from the body of a deceased dragon. As natural sorcerers, dragons possess an inherent magical essence that permeates their surroundings. However, it is important to note that not all members of the Drake-folk race are the result of exposure to this energy, as some are born into the race. </p>
      <p class="indent"> When two Drake-folk parents have a child, the child is referred to as a true Drake-folk, and there is no distinction between a true Drake-folk and a child born to a Drake-folk and another race. </p>
      <h4> DRAKEFOLK TRAITS</h4>
      <p> Your draconic mutations or heritage manifests in a variety of traits shared with other Drake-folk. </p>

      <br />
      <span class="feature">Age.</span>Drake-folk, when young, experience a slow rate of growth. They only reach the size and development of a 10-year-old human by the time they reach 30 years of age, and they only reach adulthood by the time they are 60 years old. The longest recorded lifespan of a natural Drake-folk was 650 years. However, if a Drake-folk was created by radiation, their age is determined by their previous race, with an additional 75 years added to their lifespan.
