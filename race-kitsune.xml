      <p class="flavor">As an Kitsune, you are a humanoid creature with distinct vulpine features. You possess the head and fur of a fox, including its pointed ears and bushy tail. However, your body and limbs are humanoid in shape, and you stand upright like a human. Your fur can range in color from red, orange, and brown to gray, white, and black, and your eyes are often bright and intelligent, reflecting your sharp wit and cunning nature. With your agility, quick reflexes, and keen senses, you are well-suited for a variety of professions, from cunning rogues and quick-footed rangers to mystical druids and wily bards.</p>
